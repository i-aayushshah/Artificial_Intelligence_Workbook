<aiml>
        AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) script for handling knowledge-related queries.
        This script defines patterns and templates for answering questions about types of knowledge,
        providing examples, and handling context-sensitive follow-ups. It includes redirects for
        alternative phrasings and supports variations in user input (e.g., "mybot", "please").
