    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will create simple visualisations (plots) from a classic machine learning dataset.\n",
    "    - The key first stage in any AI / Data science project is creating 'Data Visualisations' -- such as 2D and 3D scatter plots with different colourings to examine the relationships between the values of different features in your data set.\n",
    "    - We will do this with the Iris data, which contains measurements of 150 different Iris flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook will introduce the unsupervised clustering algorithm 'k-Means'.\n",
    "    - K-Means is run on the Iris data and we can examine the effect of different settings for parameters such as the number of clusters\n",
    "    - We will use the industry-standard <code>scikit-learn</code> package to do unsupervised clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third part of this workbook will explore more sophisticated visualisations.\n",
    "    - For example colouring points in a scatter plot according to what cluster they are assigned to.\n",
    "    - In this part you will also create the file you submit for marking: by bringing together code snippets from activities 1-3."
